          <h4>Got blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
        
        For the JS Variables and Objects kata. I was stuck on the last 3 tests for more than I should have been. One of the questions was, "The first element in the value of members should be 'Mary'." I turned to Google to do a thorough research the 3 problems. With about 30 minutes of research I couldn't get anything, so I turned back to my codes and attemtped to try different processes and techniques. And that's when I realised that I was paying too much attention to the messages, rather than the actual code itself. I had forgotten that the first element is at the start of the array so there is no distance. Therefore the offset is 0.
      <br>
        <br>
        Problem:
      <br>
        members[1] = 'Mary'
      <br>
        <br>
        Solution:
      <br>
        members[0] = 'Mary'
      <p></p>
        
          <h4>Solved a problem in an elegant way:</h4>
        
        I don't think I've solved any of the tests in an elegant way. But going through this helped me to build a rough idea of how I might go about solving problems. My proccess is usually doing my research on the problem, then comparing my codes with the sample solutions, but I need to make sure pseudocode becomes a regular routine.
      <p></p>
        
          <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>
        
        <li>
          Pseudocode: This method helped me to understand some problems I faced in the katas by breaking down the codes in plain English. And it made me feel comfortable to know I was at least making some progress.
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>
          Trying something: Trying different ways to solve problems was definitely part of trying to figure out what could be the best and useful method for myself.
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>
          Rubber ducky method: I tried pseudocode more than I to the rubber ducky method. But I understand that talking through and understanding the problem from another perspective is a very helpful tool.
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>
          Reading error messages: Used this almost every tests.
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>
          Console.logging: I try to use console.logging as much as possible but I can't seem to consistently figure it out. 
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>
          Googling: Useful search engine helped me to further understand some solutions.
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>
          Asking your peers for help: I go through the foundations channel to see if anyone else is going through a similar obstacle. And it's reassuring to know that the others are going through the same challenges as I am.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Asking coaches for help: I try to do this often and most times I get support and a lot of feedback.
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>
          Improving your process with reflection: It's helped me to be more aware and undetstand the differences between things I'm capable of doing and vice versa.
