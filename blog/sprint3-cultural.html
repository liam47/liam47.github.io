        What is Emotional Intelligence?
      </li>
      Emotional Intelligence is not to be misunderstood as having simply to do with emotions. EQ is the capacity to integrate our experiences, and to gain a more complete picture of life in every moment, on purpose. It requires awareness, attention and discipline. This helps us to respond freely without having to follow patterns.

        How is it different to IQ?
      </li>
      Studies show that EQ is twice as important in a working environment
as compared to IQ.  The more you understand yourself, the higher you reach. Research shows that there are 6 factors (4/6 factors relate to EQ)
that seperate top performers, from the average performer (tech sector).
<br>6 factors:</br>
<ol>
  <li>
    Achievement drive and standards
  </li>
  <li>
    Influence
  </li>
  <li>
    Conceptual Thinking
  </li>
  <li>
    Analytical Ability
  </li>
  <li>
    Initiative
  </li>
  <li>
    Self-Confidence
  </li>
</ol>
<p></p>
  <li>
    Why is it important?
  </li>
  In an ideal society it would be routine to be taught EQ from the youngest age, before we have the opportunity to make more mistakes. While technical intelligence has led us to many discoveries. It would be ideal for us to depend on a capacity to master EQ and to teach for the following generations.
