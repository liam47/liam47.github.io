        <li>
          An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:
        </li>
        HTML files contain the foundations of a webpage. It's like the structure of a building. As CSS would be it's design of the building.
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones):
        </li>
        Control flow is the order in which individual programming codes are executed or evaluated. For instance. Checking your friends list on social media. For every friend there's a individual variable number. You could program this by using control flow. But it would be a repeatative process. Whereas, loops are enabled to shorten programs/ applications.
        <br>
        <h3><p>Reference:</p></h3>
        <h4>Control flow:</h4>
show_friend($user->friends[0]);<br>
show_friend($user->friends[1]);<br>
show_friend($user->friends[2]);<br>
<h4>Loops:</h4>
foreach(var $friend in $user->friends) {
  show_friend($friend);
}
        <p></p>
        <li>
        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:
        </li>
        HTML and CSS are two of the fundamental languages found almost everywhere on the web. DOM (Document Object Model) provides the means to interact with objects in an HTML document. Such as playing around with inspect element.
        <p></p>
        <li>
        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:
        </li>
        Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed by using either dot or bracket notations. Whereas, arrays use zero-based indexing. The first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on.
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Explain what functions are and why they are useful:
      </li>
      A function is a set of statements and is only executed when and event or call is made for the function. They are resubale within the same script and or other documents. Which means that the user doesn't have to rewrite a code every single time. This cam help with big programs as users can divide big programs into a more managable function.
