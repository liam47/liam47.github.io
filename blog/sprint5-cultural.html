          <b>What new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b>
        </li>
      <p></p>
          I've learnt that to think like a developer, is to understand that problem solving is the most imortant aspect in developing as a programmer. But it is also to have a clear mind and idea of how to approach situations, tech or not. Throughout the course of my learning, I've discovered whenever I come to a hault in my learning I tend to feel uncapable and as a result I would over complicate my task. 
      <p></p>

          <b>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</b>
        </li>
      <p></p> 
          Being more aware of your mindset towards your learning experience may enable to undertsnad, empathise and be aware of others, in a working environment.

        <li>
          <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>
        </li>
      <p></p>
          From what I've learnt in my core learning is that these are some aspects I've heard from personal experiences. I was able to realize things I had to improve on individually. While I still struggle to implement this.

        <li>
          <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>
        </li>
      <p></p>
          Trying to understand myself might have been the most challenging. Coming into Foundations, I never would have guessed that mental health is one of, if not the most important aspect in web development. But I found it difficult to show it. Throughout core learning I gradually started to realise, I may not know mysefl as well as I thought.
        <li>
      <p></p>
          <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</b>
        </li>
      <p></p>
          From understanding growth mindset. A successful working enrionment is having a solid foundation, undertsnading your own core skills may lead to a better understanding of empathy and chemistry with other groups, building us as more knowledgeable employees.
