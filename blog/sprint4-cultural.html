      <h4>Research Neuroplasticity:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:
        </li>
        Neuroplasticity makes your brain extremely resilient and is the process by which all permanent learning takes place in the human brain. Such as recovering from brain events such as strokes, or mastering other languages.
      <p></p>
        <li>
          Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit:
        </li>
        I can benefit neuroplasticity by looking back through notes and to summarise my studies previously so that I can remind myself where I last left off. This may widen my range of enchanted cognitive abilities.
        <p></p>
        <li>
          What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity:
        </li>
        Sleeping:
        <br>It helps encourage learning retention through the growth of the dendritic spines. This acts as connections between neurons and cells.
        <br>Travelling:
        <br>Like a freeway system connecting to various cities. The more cars travelling to a certain destination, the wider the road becomes and vice versa. This can literally enable and expose my brain to new environments, thus opening up to new pathways and activities in the human brain.

      <h4>Research Growth Mindset:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:
        </li>
        Growth Mindset is the idea that one can enable themselves to be in control of their own ability, and can learn and improve. It is the idea of success. This should, ideally be practiced at a young age as parents should never praise their children by talking about their ability, but to describe the effort that they put in and how much they have learned and developed.
        <p></p>
        <li>
          In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you:
        </li>
        That acknowledging your efforts and process can help your brain growth. That people with growth mindset. The mind is the most responsive when being told what to improve on. Rather than being fixed on given information about how well they did.
        <p></p>
        <li>
          How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey:
        </li>
        This foundation has helped me to realise that acknowledging my efforts and process as helped me to persevere my learning experience. I will continue to do so as well as understanding that itâ€™s okay to struggle.
